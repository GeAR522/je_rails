# README

This is a project I am building, I am planning to make it an app about Jersey, the island I live on and love.

The current TODO list:

- Finish connecting up the login logout registration stuff

- Add in the comment form and components

- Finish adjusting the devise_jwt to add in refresh tokens and not just access tokens.

- add a salt to the set up of passwords

- Write a better summary/ReadME

## Main Goal

My eventual aim with this webapp will be to have an sections dedicated to the 12 parishes and things to do/see in them, as well as a general tourism section to help people plan holidays and things to do here in Jersey.

This will be done by showing off images, links to businesses, descriptions, and eventually some review sections.

## A Side Quest

Add some information about current housing prices, income, etc. Jersey is nice, but it's not all good and I think this is a serious issue.

## Future Plan

I want to learn more about threejs as I would love to build interative models as a way to help people navigate websites in new and interesting ways. I also want to learn more about D3js to show data/information in more interesting and interactive ways to help people better connect with trends and data-driven decisions.
